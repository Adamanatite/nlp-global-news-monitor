Sources:
URL (VARCHAR) PK
Name (VARCHAR)
Country (VARCHAR)
Language (VARCHAR)
Active (Binary)

Articles:
URL (VARCHAR) PK
Title (VARCHAR)
Text (VARCHAR)
Publish date (DATETIME)
Source (FK to Sources)

Settings:
Stale-duration: (INT) # How long since last new article until we decide an article is stale

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenges:
    -How do we validate if a url works
    -How do we determine language abd country without explicitly stating it (through ML?)
    -How do we determine source name?
    -What do we do with publish date when we can't scrape it?
    -How to represent broken links (null text field?)
    -How to calculate stale fields? (get publish date of articles and check latest one?)
    -Should we assume monolanguage sources? (Can we allow sources who publish in multiple languages, if so how do we represent this? Instead store language in article?)
    -More experimentation is required to decide the max length for e.g. article title
